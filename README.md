💎 Click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.
💎 Choose the account or organization where you want to fork the repository.
💎 Once forked, you will have a new repository under your account.


🪐 Setting Up Environment Variables ALWAYS

💎 In the root directory of the cloned repository, create a file named .env.local.
Add the following environment variables with their respective values:

💎 NEXTAUTH_URL=""
💎 NEXTAUTH_SECRET=""
💎 MONGO_URI=""
You can use any mongoDB database you want, create a new one or find the credentials for the existing one.

🪐 Deploying a Next.js Project on Contabo:


Unfortunately, Contabo's specific deployment process may vary, but here's a general guide:
Prepare your Next.js application for deployment:

💎 Connect to your Contabo server via SSH.
💎 Transfer your Next.js project files to the server, either via SCP or Git.
💎 Install Node.js and npm on your Contabo server if they are not already installed.
💎 Install PM2 globally (npm install -g pm2) for process management.
💎 Navigate to your project directory and run npm install --production to install production dependencies.
💎 Start your Next.js application with PM2: pm2 start npm --name "my-nextjs-app" -- start.
Optionally, set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache to route incoming HTTP requests to your Next.js application.
💎 Set up domain and DNS:

💎 Configure your domain's DNS settings to point to your Contabo server's IP address.
💎 Configure Nginx your Contabo server to serve your Next.js application at your domain.
💎 Secure your deployment:
💎 Set up SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS encryption using Let's Encrypt or a similar service.
